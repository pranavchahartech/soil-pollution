            <h2>What is Soil Pollution</h2>
            <p>
            Soil pollution refers to anything that causes contamination of soil and degrades the soil quality. It occurs when the pollutants causing the pollution reduce the quality of the soil and convert the soil inhabitable for microorganisms and macro organisms living in the soil.

Soil contamination or soil pollution can occur either because of human activities or because of natural processes. However, mostly it is due to human activities. The soil contamination can occur due to the presence of chemicals such as pesticides, herbicides, ammonia, petroleum hydrocarbons, lead, nitrate, mercury, naphthalene, etc in an excess amount.

The primary cause of soil pollution is a lack of awareness in general people. Thus, due to many different human activities such as overuse of pesticides the soil will lose its fertility. Moreover, the presence of excess chemicals will increase the alkalinity or acidity of soil thus degrading the soil quality. This will in turn cause soil erosion. This soil erosion refers to soil pollution.</p>

    <section id="causes">
        <div class="container">
            <h2>Causes of Soil Pollution</h2>

            <p>Various sources of soil pollution are:
            <h3>Agricultural Source</h3>
             Agricultural practices such as the use of non-organic products in crop and livestock production lead to soil pollution. These substances include artificial chemical pesticides, herbicides, fungicides, and fertilizers.<br />
             The introduction of modern pesticides, herbicides, and insecticides has resulted in an increase in the use of agricultural chemicals. These chemicals are used to control the pests, insects, weeds, fungi, and diseases that attack crops.Most of these chemicals are non-biodegradable, while others decompose to products that are toxic to soil. These products seep into the ground and act on the soil, thereby changing its structure, composition, and pH.<br> 
             Also fertilizers are one of the major agricultural source of soil pollution. Since fertilizers are mostly used to correct the deficiency of soil nutrients, a soil that is deficient of potassium, calcium, nitrogen, and sulfur, among other important macro-nutrients, should be treated with the right fertilizer and at the right amount, However, some farmers use fertilizers indiscriminately, leading to soil pollution. What is more, the materials used to manufacture fertilizers contain impurities that add to soil toxicity. For instance, the rock phosphates mineral used for the manufacture of mixed fertilizers contain traces of Asbestos, Cadmium, and Lead, which are transferred to the fertilizer during production. These metals are non-biodegradable and, with time, accumulate to toxic levels.<br>
            <h3>Industrial Source</h3>
            Industrial wastes or byproducts are among the leading causes of soil pollution. They can be in the form of gas, liquid, or solid substances. Carbon dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and carbon monoxide are some of the gases produced from industrial activities that cause considerable pollution to soil indirectly. These byproducts combine with the rainwater causing the production of acidic rain, which changes the soil pH and, after that, affects the overall crop production. Industries also dump their solid and liquid effluents into the soil.<br>
            <h3>Urban Source</h3>
            Most developing countries have a problem controlling the disposal of municipal garbage. The garbage is dumped anyhow and contains wastes such as food waste, plastics, industrial wastes, e-waste, and general household wastes.It appears as if the urban administrators do not know that most of the non-biodegradable waste materials could be recycled and the organic materials disposed of in areas designated for natural decomposition.<br>
            <h3>Sewer Sludge</h3>
            Sewage plants also contribute to soil pollution owing to how they dispose of sewage sludge from domestic and commercial waste. The sewage sludge is usually treated before being disposed of into land or water bodies. When disposed of on land, the sludge can release high amounts of nutrients depending on the source that may surpass the natural soil nutrient requirement, thus posing a risk to human health and/or the ecosystem at large. Sewer sludge may also contain high levels of metals, further polluting the soil.<br>
            <h3>Mining And Smelting Sources</h3>
            Mining activities cause soil pollution on a large scale. The operations cause a change of the landscape and expose the previously undisturbed soils to the elements of weather. Erosion of the soil containing some traces of mineral ores and fine materials around the mining areas results in sediment loading in the water sources and drainage ways. They end up in the soil through irrigation and flowing stormwater. There are also other hazardous materials that leak from mining activities, including harmful dust particles that are deposited on the surrounding soils. In developing countries, the pollution levels are even higher because activities such as gold mining are done using traditional methods, which lead to the release of mercury and other heavy metals into rivers and neighboring lands.<br>
            <h3>Nuclear Source</h3>
            Every living organism is continuously exposed to background radiation. If the levels of these radiations exceed a given limit, they lead to disastrous effects. Radiation pollution results from two sources, that is, the natural and anthropogenic actions. In nature, there are radioactive minerals that contribute to soil pollution such as radionuclides of radon-222 and Radium -226, Thorium, Uranium, isotopes of Potassium (K-40) and Carbon (C-14) are commonly found in soil, rock, water and air. All the radionuclides deposited on the soil emit gamma radiations. The explosion of hydrogen weapons and cosmic radiations include neutron, proton reactions by which Nitrogen (N-15) produces C-14. This C-14 participates in Carbon metabolism of plants, which is then transmitted into animals and human beings. Radioactive waste contains several radionuclides such as Strontium90, Iodine129, Cesium-137 and isotopes of Iron, which are most injurious. Strontium gets deposited in bones and tissues instead of calcium. Improper disposal of wastes from nuclear reactors containing Ruthenium-106, Iodine-131, Barium140, Cesium-144 and Lanthanum-140 along with primary nuclides Sr-90 with a half-life 28 years and Cs-137 with a half-life 30 years can, therefore, result in soil pollution and contamination. Rainwater carries Sr-90 and Cs-137 to be deposited on the soil, where they are held firmly with the soil particles by electrostatic forces. <br>
            <h3>Deforestation</h3>
            Though not a direct contributing factor to soil pollution, deforestation leads to the removal of the shield that protects the soil against the agents of erosion. The exposed soil is easily eroded and exposed to artificial chemical pollutants from the air, wind, and rain. <br>
            <h3>Biological Agents And Acid Rain</h3>
            Soil gets a large amount of human, animal and bird excreta, which constitute a major source of land pollution by biological agents where as when pollutants in the air such as sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide mix with rain acid rain occurs, which has been found to impact soil negatively by dissolving important nutrients and even changing the soilâ€™s structure.<br></p>

            <h2>Effects of Soil Pollution</h2>
           
            <p>
            Soil pollution harbours a broad spectrum of negative consequences that affect plants, animals, humans, and the ecosystem as a whole. Since children are more susceptible to diseases, polluted soil poses a greater threat to them. Some important effects of soil pollution are detailed in this subsection. <br>
            <h3>Effects on Human Beings</h3>
            Soil contaminants can exist in all three phases (solid, liquid, and gaseous). Therefore, these contaminants can find their way into the human body via several channels such as direct contact with the skin or through the inhalation of contaminated soil dust.<br>
            The short term effects of human exposure to polluted soil include.
            <ul>
            <li> Headaches, nausea, and vomiting.</li>
            <li> Coughing, pain in the chest, and wheezing.</li>
            <li> irritation of the skin and the eyes.</li>
            <li> Fatigue and weakness.</li></ul><br>
            A variety of long-term ailments have been linked to soil pollution. Some such diseases are listed below.
            <ul>
            <li>Exposure to high levels of lead can result in permanent damage to the nervous system. Children are particularly vulnerable to lead.</li>
            <li>Depression of the CNS (Central Nervous System).</li>
            <li>Damage to vital organs such as the kidney and the liver.</li>
            <li>Higher risk of developing cancer.</li></ul><br>
            It can be noted that many soil pollutants such as petroleum hydrocarbons and industrial solvents have been linked to congenital disorders in humans. Thus, soil pollution can have several negative effects on human health.<br>
            <h3>Effects on Plants and Animals</h3>
            Since soil pollution is often accompanied by a decrease in the availability of nutrients, plant life ceases to thrive in such soils. Soils contaminated with inorganic aluminium can prove toxic to plants. Also, this type of pollution often increases the salinity of the soil, making it inhospitable for the growth of plant life.<br>
            Plants that are grown in polluted soil may accumulate high concentrations of soil pollutants through a process known as bioaccumulation. When these plants are consumed by herbivores, all the accumulated pollutants are passed up the food chain. This can result in the loss/extinction of many desirable animal species. Also, these pollutants can eventually make their way to the top of the food chain and manifest as diseases in human beings.<br>
             <h3>Effects on Ecoysystem</h3>
             <ul>
             <li>Since the volatile contaminants in the soil can be carried away into the atmosphere by winds or can seep into underground water reserves, soil pollution can be a direct contributor to air and water pollution.</li>
             <li>It can also contribute to acid rain (by releasing huge quantities of ammonia into the atmosphere).</li>
             <li>Acidic soils are inhospitable to several microorganisms that improve soil texture and help in the decomposition of organic matter. Thus, the negative effects of soil pollution also impact soil quality and texture.</li>
             <li>Crop yield is greatly affected by this form of pollution. In China, over 12 million tons of grain (worth approximately 2.6 billion USD) is found to be unfit for human consumption due to contamination with heavy metals (as per studies conducted by the China Dialogue).</li>
             </ul>

            <h2>Soil Pollution Management</h2>
            <p>It is a serious environmental concern since it harbours many health hazards. For example, exposure to soil containing high concentrations of benzene increases the risk of contracting leukaemia. It is important to understand that all soils contain compounds that are harmful/toxic to human beings and other living organisms. However, the concentration of such substances in unpolluted soil is low enough that they do not pose any threat to the surrounding ecosystem. When the concentration of one or more such toxic substances is high enough to cause damage to living organisms, the soil is said to be contaminated.The challenges faced in soil remediation (decontamination of soil) are closely related to the extent of soil pollution. The greater the contamination, the greater the requirement for resources for remediation.</p>

            <h2>Prevention and Solutions</h2>
           
            <p>
              The biological method refers to forestry and crop-related soil management. The crop related control measures include crop rotation, strip cropping, planting along the contours, protector belt, crop residues, and use of organic composts. Forests also play an important role in preventing soil erosion.

Developing forests in new areas can help reduce erosion caused by rainwater and air thus ensuring increased soil fertility and formation. In areas with excessive pollution or surface degradation, reforestation should be done. The mechanical method of soil pollution control includes the use of contour holding system, gully control, and making bunds. In excessive sloping areas, making bunds across the slope helps to prevent erosion.<br>
            It is important to dispose of solid waste properly by treated it before itâ€™s released into the environment. Acidic and alkaline waste, for example, can be neutralized before they are disposed of to avoid soil contamination. Biodegradable waste should also be broken down in a controlled environment before it is released into the environment. A great example is the proper treatment of sewage sludge.

The waste materials should also be categorized based on the degree of contamination. Materials that are mildly or moderately contaminated should be treated in controlled environments before release into the natural environments while those that are heavily contaminated should be put under strict management, treatment, and control.<br>
            When dealing with land that is expected to be reclaimed and used for other purposes such as the construction of residential homes or social amenities like schools as it is in the case of mining, there is need to conduct soil investigation and evaluation. The mandate of testing the contamination levels of such lands should be given to the city or government unit in charge.

The results from the test should then be used in establishing practical management and control measures depending on the purpose of the land. If the results show the reclaimed land is polluted, any scheduled activity on the land must be suspended and the responsible body must take the necessary precautions to not only manage and mitigate the risks but to also prevent the contamination of adjacent soils.<br>
             The best way to control soil pollution is to strictly control the mining and industrial pollutants. In addition to controlling the pollutants, daily environment supervision should be enhanced. This should be implemented by making a layout plan that should include close supervision on the soil environment including regular information updates. To ensure accountability, the companies in the specified area should conduct soil research at least once annually and release the information to the public.

Surrounding soil should also be monitored on a regular basis to ensure the soil is not contaminated. The relevant authorities should also proactively look for potential risks and point out the alternatives for minimizing the risks. The government should also put in place measures to ensure electronic wastes and heavy metals do not contaminate the soil. At the same time, the government should take stronger measures against people, businesses, and companies that breach the policies.

Furthermore, through legislation, the government should phase out production facilities that use traditional industrial production methods and agricultural practices that harm the soil. Instead, the state should encourage enterprises to adopt better methods of production, organic farming, and new technology as it would be helpful in ensuring proper treatment of wastes and the reduction in harmful chemical products.</p>
